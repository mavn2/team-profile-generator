## Description

I was asked to create an application a manager could use to quickly create a presentable HTML page for viewing their team members and associated information.
I was provided with a suite of tests to ensure that the required information would be effectively saved, as well as some HTML code represented the desired end product, and left to develop the rest of the application however I thought would best achieve the above goal.
The resulting program uses the NPM Inquirer module to present a command line interface and receive user data.
It then uses a series of functions to store that data in objects and retrieve it for use in a pre-written HTML page, allowing the user to create a flexible, professional looking home-page for their team within minutes.

## Installation

First, clone or download this repository.
Second, run npm install from your terminal in the containing directory to install the required modules.
Finally, run the app using the command 'node app'.

## Usage

Follow the provided prompts! The app is designed to take care of everything else for you. If desired, a user could customize a page's HTML or add pre-written CSS.

## License

Use of this application is governed by the MIT license.

## Contributing

I took this project as a chance to learn more about asynchronous programming and complex JavaScript generally, but that focus means the app could absolutely benefit from some streamlining.
If you feel an element of the code could be improved, I'd love to see what you do!
Users should also feel free to customize the included HTML code as they see fit.

## Tests

Run the program! Run it as many times as you want, however you want. Please contact me if you find that it isn't resilient.
